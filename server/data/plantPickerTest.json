  "description": " While these tropical fruiting plants are commonly referred to as trees, they’re technically huge herbaceous plants, as they don’t have a woody stem. Instead, they have fleshy, upright stalks from which large, oblong, bright green leaves grow. Showy flowers appear typically in the spring, giving way to the fleshy, elongated, green or yellow fruit. While most species grow best in warm climates, there also are somewhat cold-hardy banana trees. Plus, they can make good houseplants with enough light, though they typically don't bear fruit indoors.",

Grow this plant in a location where it will be sheltered from strong winds, as it is very susceptible to damaged leaves. Prepare your planting site by mixing some compost into the soil. And make sure you have enough space for the height and spread of your particular species. During the growing season (spring to fall), banana trees are water hogs. You might have to water daily, especially during hot weather, to maintain adequate soil moisture. The plants also will need regular fertilization throughout the growing season."
