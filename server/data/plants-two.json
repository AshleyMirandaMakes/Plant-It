    "description": "String of pearls plants are unique vining succulents that are easily recognizable by their almost spherical, tiny pea-shaped leaves. The leaves grow on trailing stems that gracefully spill over the sides of planters and hanging baskets. You can use these stems to propagate the plant, which is a very robust and quick grower but does not live long without propagation. Though normally cultivated year-round as a hanging plant, in its natural habitat (the deserts of East Africa) the string of pearls is terrestrial and forms a ground cover. In addition to its peculiar sphere-like leaves, the string of pearls produces white flowers in spring with a pleasant scent reminiscent of cinnamon (though it rarely flowers indoors).",

    "care" : "The string of pearls plant is not particular about its conditions. Given enough light and fertilizer, it will grow quite vigorously in a season. A single plant will survive for about five years if properly cared for, but if you propagate new plants from stem cuttings, you can effectively keep it alive indefinitely. To enable this plant to shine, consider growing string of pearls with multiple stems in a hanging basket. Its stems can also be twined together, and you can also grow it in a dish, allowing it to form a terrestrial mat the way it does in the wild. String of pearls has no major pest or disease problems, and it doesn’t require much care. It does, however, need plenty of light all year."

    "description": "These hardy plants will survive less-than-perfect conditions, and they are stunning when you can mimic their native tropical environment. These plants grow slender, gently arching leaves that can stretch from around 1 to 1.5 feet long on average. The leaves can be green or striped green and white. Mature plants regularly send out long stems that bear small, star-shaped flowers. Once the flowers fall off, tiny plantlets form in their place, which ultimately grow their own roots. Spider plants can typically be planted at any time as long as they are not exposed to frost. They have a moderate growth rate.",

If you place their container on something rather than hanging it, make sure the long leaves aren’t getting crushed and the long plantlet stems don’t get so heavy that they pull over the pot. In warm climates, spider plants do well in outdoor planters and as ground cover plants. "

Due to the plant's eye-catching stripes and veining, they're often known by nicknames such as the zebra plant, peacock plant, or rattlesnake plant. Native to Brazil and grown indoors year-round, calathea are true tropicals in every sense of the word, gaining a reputation for being somewhat fussy about their grow conditions.

Despite the common name and the appearance of the foliage, this is not a true palm, but rather a member of the Asparagaceae family that includes edible asparagus! Indoors, these novel little trees are often grown in shallow pots, with a tuft of strappy green leaves emerging from a bulbous stem that seems to erupt from the soil. Given time and the right conditions, a small desktop plant will grow into respectable specimen plants, up to 6 feet in height or more.

As an indoor plant, the ponytail is basically a ~plant it and forget it~ kind of plant, providing it has enough light to thrive and somewhat steady water throughout the growing season. Keep in mind, though, that the ponytail palm is an extremely slow-growing plant, so don't expect your desktop plant to transform into a corner specimen in one or two growing seasons."

Potted plants are often moved outdoors for the summer months, and in regions without frost, they are sometimes grown as garden plants. These small, low-growing plants form rosettes of fleshy green leaves that are generously covered with white, pearly warts or bands, giving them a distinctive appearance. Generally easy to grow, the same best practices that yield healthy aloe and echeveria plants will also produce beautiful Haworthia plants. Like other succulents, these plants appreciate bright light and adequate moisture in the summer, and relatively drier conditions in the winter.

At the same time, these little decorative plants can be grown in interesting containers such as teacups and even miniature baby shoes. If you've given a Haworthia in such a container, make sure the container had adequate drainage. If it doesn't, it might be a good idea to pop the plant out of its container and add a layer of gravel to the bottom to reduce the wicking action of the soil above.

These plants are native to tropical parts of Africa, where they thrive in very warm and wet conditions. This makes them somewhat challenging for the home grower, who is likely to have trouble duplicating these steamy conditions. However, they are relatively tough plants that can withstand a less-than-perfect environment for a fairly long time. Fiddle-leaf figs are perfect as focal points of a room if you can situate them in a floor-standing container where the plant is allowed to grow to at least 6 feet.

When grown as a houseplant, be prepared to rotate your fiddle-leaf fig every few days so a different part faces the light source. That way, it will grow evenly, rather than lean toward the light. Also, every week or two dust the leaves with a damp cloth. Not only does this make the leaves appear shinier and more appealing, but it also allows more sunlight to hit the leaves for photosynthesis. Moreover, you can trim off any damaged or dead leaves as they arise, as they no longer benefit the plant. And if you wish, you can prune off the top of the main stem for a bushier growth habit."

The rubber plant has waxy-looking leaves that start out a pink-coral hue, eventually deepening to a dark rich green. As the rubber plant grows it will begin to droop, so it's important that you help support them by using a long wooden dowel (or bamboo stalk) to help keep them upright. They can tolerate soft morning sunlight but should be moved out of the line of harsh direct rays in the afternoon as they can singe the leaves. Plants that do not receive sufficient light will become leggy, lose their lower leaves, and their leaf color will become dull instead of glossy and vibrant."
